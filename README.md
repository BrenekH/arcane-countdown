# Arcane Countdown

Countdown timer until Arcane Season 2.

More specifically, this website is counting down to November 9th at midnight PST, which is when Act 1 will be released.
After a day, the website will automatically start tracking Act 2 a week later, and Act 3 a week after that.

Once all of Season 2 is released, the website will just have a button to take any visitors to Netflix to watch Arcane.
